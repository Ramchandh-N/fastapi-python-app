# Virtual Environment Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps to create and use a virtual environment for your Python project, including installing dependencies and running a FastAPI application.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- `pip` (Python's package manager) installed

---

## Steps to Set Up and Use a Virtual Environment

### 1. Install `virtualenv` (if not already installed)

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Alternatively, use Python's built-in `venv` module:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
(or)
python -m venv venv
```

---

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment named `venv`:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

---

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

#### On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 4. Install Dependencies in the Virtual Environment

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 5. Run the Application in the Virtual Environment

With the virtual environment activated, run your FastAPI app:

```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

---

## Additional Notes

- To deactivate the virtual environment, use the command:
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

Happy coding!
